## Technologies used

This application uses `Next.js` with `Typescript`.

Cryptocurrency data is taken from the `Coingecko price API`

The `Radix UI` and `Headless UI` component libraries have been used in order to create the base of the components. This allows us to have well tested, reliable and accessible components, while reducing the overhead of creating and managing various components.

`D3.js` is used in order to display performant, flexible and animated graphs.
